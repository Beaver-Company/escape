At its core Escape provides abstractions to work with _units of deployments_. A
_unit of deployment_ is a collection of files, plus a bit of metadata to tell
Escape what it can do. Based on the metadata Escape knows how to build, test,
deploy, destroy and operate the unit.

Metadata doesn't have to be written by hand, but can be compiled from an
_Escape plan_. The smallest Escape plan looks like this:

```
name: my-project/my-deployment-unit
version: 1.0
```

(Pro-tip: A documented, but otherwise fairly similar Escape plan, can be
generated by running `escape plan init -n my-deployment-unit`. You can also
format existing plans in this manner by running `escape plan fmt`)
